## PyData Orono

PyData Orono is the Orono, ME branch of [PyData](https://pydata.org) and the only PyData chapter north of Boston in the eastern U.S. We welcome people from all over who are interested in data science regardless of prior experience. 

### Upcoming Events 

We generally host meetups once per month in Orono at the UMaine (and ocassionally in Bangor at Covorts). The majority of meetups contain a presentation followed by open ended discussion about the topic. Ocassionally, we host informal gatherings at local cafes or restaurants such as the [Nest](https://www.facebook.com/NestCoffeeOrono/) and [Family Dog](https://www.thefamilydogorono.com). For more details on upcoming meetups please see our [official meetup page](http://meetup.com/PyData-Orono/). If you are interested in presenting please message [igodfried@isaac26.com](igodfried@isaac26.com). We accept presentations that cover any aspect of data science from statistical analysis of data, to data manipulation/cleaning, to data visualization, to machine learning/AI.
